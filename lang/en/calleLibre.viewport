# Isakov - Calle Libre

![[yt(square):EtzdSiiG1Bo"]]

For the <a href="https://www.callelibre.at/festival/2023" taget="_blank">Calle Libre Festival 2023</a>, our multimedia class, then the 3aHMNM, was commissioned to bring to life graffiti artworks created during previous festivals using AR. Here, <a href="www.isakov.de">Isakov Alexander</a>â€™s work stood out prominently.

The illustrative style provided many opportunities to incorporate movement and life into the artwork. Its abstract nature allows each viewer to imagine something unique.

Unfortunately, finalization was not possible due to organizational reasons. However, the project can still be viewed in Vienna.
