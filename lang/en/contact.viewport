# Nice to meet you!

Now onto the uncomfortable part, at least I always find it awkward to phrase: the contact page.
*It was nice meeting you, and I look forward to the next time we hear from each other, or even see each other!* ...
...I'll say once our paths diverge after we've met. Do you want to get to know me, and for me to get to know you a bit more too? Don't hesitate, go ahead! Shoot me an email!
What, you're unsure? Oh come on... Take a [look around a bit](projects), I'm sure I'll convince you! ;)
